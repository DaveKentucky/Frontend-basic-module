## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This task helped me to revise some useful CSS functionalities, like grids, flexboxes and media queries. Also I have had an opportunity to look at interesting colors combinations in the example screenshots, which helped me choose a better colors palette for my solution. The realization of mobile version was a good occasion to see how are modern mmobile apps configured to fit mobile screens.

### Continued development

I would like to focus more on CSS grids in my further projects, as this functionality is extremely useful for development of modern solutions including responsive design. The responsiveness itself is a crucial topic nowadays, which is going to be my learning target as well.
